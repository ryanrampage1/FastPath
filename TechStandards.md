**1. Overview**

This document outlines the mandatory technical standards, technologies, and development practices for the Intermittent Fasting Tracker iOS application. Adherence ensures consistency, maintainability, and leverages modern Swift development paradigms as specified.

**2. Core Technologies & Architecture**

* **TS-001: Programming Language:**
    * **Standard:** Swift (latest stable version compatible with specified libraries).
    * **Rationale:** Native iOS development language.

* **TS-002: User Interface Framework:**
    * **Standard:** SwiftUI.
    * **Rationale:** Modern, declarative UI framework for iOS specified for this project. Avoid UIKit unless strictly necessary for features unavailable in SwiftUI and approved beforehand.

* **TS-003: Application Architecture:**
    * **Standard:** The Composable Architecture (TCA) by Point-Free.
    * **Reference:** [https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)
    * **Rationale:** Provides a consistent, testable, and composable way to structure the application state, actions, and side effects, as specified.
    * **Implementation:** Adhere strictly to TCA principles (State, Action, Reducer, Environment, Store). Structure features as independent, composable modules.

* **TS-004: Data Persistence:**
    * **Standard:** Swift Structured Queries.
    * **Reference:** [https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries)
    * **Rationale:** Type-safe, composable library for database interactions, as specified.
    * **Implementation:** Use Swift Structured Queries for all interactions with the local database (e.g., SQLite). Define clear data models for fasting records. Integrate database operations as side effects managed within the TCA environment.

**3. Development Practices**

* **DP-001: Dependency Management:**
    * **Standard:** Swift Package Manager (SPM).
    * **Rationale:** Native Swift dependency management tool. Manage TCA, Swift Structured Queries, and any other external libraries via SPM.

* **DP-002: Version Control:**
    * **Standard:** Git.
    * **Rationale:** Industry standard for version control.
    * **Implementation:** Use a clear branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow). Write descriptive commit messages. Host the repository on an accessible platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

* **DP-003: Code Style & Quality:**
    * **Standard:** Adhere to the Swift API Design Guidelines ([https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)).
    * **Rationale:** Ensures readability and maintainability.
    * **Implementation:** Write clear, well-commented code. Consider using SwiftLint with a standard ruleset to enforce style consistency.

* **DP-004: Testing:**
    * **Standard:** Leverage TCA's built-in testing utilities.
    * **Rationale:** Ensures application logic behaves as expected.
    * **Implementation:** Write unit tests for all reducers, covering different actions and state transitions. Write integration tests for key user flows where appropriate.

* **DP-005: iOS Target & Deployment:**
    * **Standard:** Target a minimum iOS version that supports the required features of SwiftUI, TCA, and Swift Structured Queries (Confirm specific versions, e.g., iOS 15+ or 16+).
    * **Rationale:** Balances feature availability with device reach.

* **DP-006: Concurrency:**
    * **Standard:** Utilize Swift's modern concurrency features (`async`/`await`).
    * **Rationale:** Simplifies asynchronous operations.
    * **Implementation:** Use `async`/`await` for handling side effects (like database operations or timer updates) within TCA's `Effect` type.

**4. Deliverables**

* Complete source code hosted in the agreed-upon Git repository.
* A buildable Xcode project configured with SPM dependencies.
* Documentation for any complex components or setup procedures (if necessary).
* Test results or coverage reports (if requested).
