**1. Overview**

This document outlines the functional requirements for an iOS application designed to help users track their intermittent fasting periods. The application will allow users to start and stop fasting timers, view the duration of their current fast, and review a history of past fasts. All data will be stored locally on the user's device.

**2. Functional Requirements**

* **FR-001: Start Fast**
    * **Description:** The user must be able to initiate a new fasting period.
    * **Details:**
        * A prominent "Start" button shall be visible on the main screen when no fast is currently active.
        * Tapping the "Start" button shall record the precise start date and time of the fast.
        * Tapping the "Start" button shall transition the app state to "Fasting Active".

* **FR-002: Stop Fast**
    * **Description:** The user must be able to end the current fasting period.
    * **Details:**
        * A prominent "Stop" button shall be visible on the main screen when a fast is currently active.
        * Tapping the "Stop" button shall record the precise end date and time of the fast.
        * The completed fast (including start time, end time, and calculated duration) shall be saved to local storage.
        * Tapping the "Stop" button shall transition the app state to "Fasting Inactive".

* **FR-003: Active Fast Display**
    * **Description:** Display information about the ongoing fast.
    * **Details:**
        * When a fast is active, the main screen must display a running timer showing the elapsed time since the fast started.
        * The timer format should be clear (e.g., HH:MM:SS) and update dynamically (at least every second).
        * The "Start" button shall be hidden or disabled.
        * The "Stop" button shall be visible and enabled.

* **FR-004: Inactive State Display**
    * **Description:** Display information when no fast is active.
    * **Details:**
        * When no fast is active, the main screen should clearly indicate this state.
        * The timer display area should show a default state (e.g., "00:00:00" or "Tap Start to begin").
        * The "Start" button shall be visible and enabled.
        * The "Stop" button shall be hidden or disabled.

* **FR-005: Fasting History**
    * **Description:** Allow users to view their past fasting records.
    * **Details:**
        * A "History" button or navigation element must be accessible from the main screen.
        * Tapping "History" shall navigate the user to a dedicated history view.
        * The history view must display a list of all previously completed fasts.
        * Each entry in the history list must clearly show:
            * Start Date & Time
            * End Date & Time
            * Total Duration (calculated, e.g., in hours and minutes).
        * The list shall be ordered chronologically, with the most recent fast displayed first.

* **FR-006: Data Persistence**
    * **Description:** Ensure fasting data is saved locally and reliably.
    * **Details:**
        * All fasting data (start times, end times of completed fasts) must be stored locally on the iOS device.
        * This data must persist even if the application is closed, terminated, or the device is restarted.
        * The state of an *active* fast (including its start time) must be correctly restored if the app is closed and reopened while a fast is running.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR-001: Platform:** The application must be a native iOS application.
* **NFR-002: User Interface:** The UI should be clean, intuitive, and generally adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).
* **NFR-003: Data Storage:** Data storage must be entirely local to the device. No external network calls or cloud synchronization are required for version 1.0.
* **NFR-004: Performance:** The app should be responsive, with smooth timer updates and quick navigation between views.
